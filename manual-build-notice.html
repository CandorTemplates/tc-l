      Due to the custom-built nature of Squarespace templates, they cannot be applied/transferred to another site or re-installed in one click. In other words, please take care when making any edits. If you delete something, change the colours/fonts or want to recreate a section, you will need to re-install the original template settings/layout manually. <a href="https://launch.candortemplates.com/l/launch-lounge-1/back-up-your-template-1/">More info</a></a>
